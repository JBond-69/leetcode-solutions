# ðŸ§  LeetCode Solutions by Prannoy

This repository contains my personal solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by topic.  
I'm using this space to track my problem-solving journey, improve my coding skills, and build a solid DSA foundation.

Each solution is written in **Python**, and follows clean, readable practices with optional comments for clarity.

## ðŸš€ Topics Covered So Far

- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Hash Maps & Sets
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window (soon)
- Dynamic Programming (soon)

## ðŸ”§ How to Use

Each file contains the function, optional comments, and can be directly copy-pasted into LeetCode's editor.

## ðŸ§© Why This Repo?

- To practice and revisit key patterns regularly
- To share learnings with others
- To build a publicly trackable coding routine

---

## ðŸ“ˆ In Progress

I'm aiming to solve at least **X problems/week**, covering both easy and medium problems (and gradually tackling hards).  
Feel free to fork, follow, or contribute if you're doing something similar!
